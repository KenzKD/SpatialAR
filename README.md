# SpatialAR

This is an Image tracking project for college placements at MIT, Manipal for a company known as Spatial.

This is my first AR project in Unity.

The buttons aren't really functional. They were intended to allow the user to change the image that gets tracked from a URL or a an image in the gallery but I could not find away to resolve this in time for the submission as after alot of research none of the my attempts seemed to work.
